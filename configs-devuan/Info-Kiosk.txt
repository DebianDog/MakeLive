                 *** Info Kiosk ***

Restricted to browsing the internet only, no downloading is possible, porn sites blocked.
The user (not knowing 'root' password) has no access at all to the system (cannot run applications, terminal, or file-manager, etc...)

Recommended usage:
Boot with porteus-boot changes=EXIT:/.. option (if you need to configure or install something) or without changes option (nosave)

To get access to the system, to configure as administrator:
Press Alt + F3
Click the "admin" button (Debian logo icon)
After entering the 'root' password, the wbar dock wil appear, from where you can e.g. install, save session, configure firefox etc..

-------------------------------------
Firefox info:
Firefox is running in full screen, pressing F10 or closing all tabs will restart firefox.
Standard setup is 'Kiosk mode' through addon: "Webconverger"
To make changes in firefox, e.g. preferences: Click: 'Firefox-safe-mode'
Next, click 'Start in Safe Mode' 
Firefox will then run with disabled addons (so without the restricted 'Kiosk modus' addon).
After closing 'Firefox-safe-mode', click the 'Restart X' icon to go back to the kiosk mode again.
-------------------------------------

The keyboard shortcut to minimize firefox (escape from full screen) or other windows is: Alt + F3
It can be changed to something more complicated (secret) if you wish, then use 'Keybinder' from wbar to change it.
(for example something like: Shift + Ctrl + Alt + F3)

The icon on the right of wbar ('Logout') is to shutdown the computer as administrator.
If booted with the porteus-boot option EXIT:, you'll be asked to save the session or not.
So if you made important changes, click 'Save'.

The icon second on the right ('Save Session') will save during a session (in case EXIT: is used).

Clicking the icon on the bottom left (panel) will show shutdown dialog, note that it will NOT show the 'Save or Not Save' dialog (even when booted with changes=EXIT:/ option) 

Close wbar when you are done.
